/** The Department of Computer Science stores student details using arrays. There are fourdifferent arrays:
the first array contains the surname of the students, the second array contains the first name, the third
and fourth arrays contain the CA and exammarks as percentages respectively.
You are tasked with developing a program that calculates and displays the final marks of students. The
program reads the surname then the first name of a student. The program then reads the CA and the
exam mark, then it calculates the final mark for the student as a percentage using the CA and the exam
mark. The CA is 40% of the final mark, whilstthe exam is 60% of the final mark. For each student, the
program should then output the first name, surname, final mark (to 2 decimal places) and a grade. Ifthe
final mark is over 79%, the grade is an A, a final mark from 70 to 79 is a B, 60 to 69 is a C, 50 to 59 is a D,
40 to 49 is an E, and anything below 40 is an F. Assume that there are 40 students in a class.
